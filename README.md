Cheap MicroSD adapter for MMFS on Acorn BBC Micro
=================================================

There are several modern options to replace aging cassette tape or floppy
disc storage on your Acorn BBC (Master) micro.

MicroSD cards are very popular. You can wire up a 5V compatible
(important!) MicroSD board from Adafruit (ada-254) or use a generic
Arduino MicroSD board.

This repository contains the KiCad schematic, PCB layout as well as the
Gerber files for a simple "MicroSD board to Acorn userport" adapter.
